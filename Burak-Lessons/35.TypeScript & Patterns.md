# Architecture Patterns : MVC, DI, MVP and etc
MVC : Model View Controller
MVC is a design pattern that separates the application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.

DI : Dependency Injection
DI is a design pattern that allows you to decouple the creation of objects from their usage.

MVP : Model View Presenter
MVP is a design pattern that separates the application into three main components: Model, View, and Presenter.

# Design Patterns : Middleware, Decorator and etc

Middleware : Middleware is a design pattern that allows you to add additional functionality to the application without changing the core logic.

Decorator : Decorator is a design pattern that allows you to add additional functionality to the application without changing the core logic.




##### Typescript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding optional static types, classes, and modules. It's developed and maintained by Microsoft.

Why we need TypeScript:
- Type Safety: Catches errors at compile time rather than runtime
- Better IDE Support: Enhanced code completion and refactoring
- Object-Oriented Features: Classes, interfaces, and modules
- Future JavaScript Features: Access to modern JavaScript features that compile down to older versions

Advantages:
1. Enhanced Code Quality
- Fewer bugs due to type checking
- Easier to maintain large codebases
- Better documentation through type definitions

2. Better Developer Experience
- Improved autocomplete
- Easier refactoring
- Clear interface definitions

3. Enterprise-Level Development
- Scales well for large applications
- Better for team collaboration
- Clearer code organization
