# Dotenv
Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It allows you to:

- Keep sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, etc.) out of your code
- Have different configuration values for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Avoid committing secrets to version control
- Follow security best practices by separating configuration from code

The `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive information stays private and secure.

# MongoDB & Mongoose
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Key features include:
- Document-oriented storage
- High scalability and performance 
- Rich query language
- Support for aggregation and indexing
- Flexible schema design

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides:
- Schema-based solution to model application data
- Built-in type casting
- Validation
- Query building
- Business logic hooks (middleware)
- Easy data relationships management through population

Together, MongoDB and Mongoose provide a robust solution for handling data in Node.js applications, combining MongoDB's flexibility with Mongoose's structured approach.

# Express & EJS
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Key features include:
- Routing system
- Middleware support
- Static file serving
- Template engine support
- Error handling
- Request parsing
- Response helpers

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. Its features include:
- Fast compilation and rendering
- Simple syntax with plain JavaScript
- Both server-side and client-side support
- Static caching of templates
- Easy integration with Express
- Includes support for partials


# Path
The `path` module is a built-in Node.js utility module that provides tools for working with file and directory paths. It helps handle path-related operations consistently across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).

Key features of the path module:
- Handles path separators correctly for different OS (/ vs \)
- Normalizes paths
- Resolves relative paths
- Extracts path components (directory, filename, extension)

`path.join()` is a method that joins path segments using the platform-specific separator
